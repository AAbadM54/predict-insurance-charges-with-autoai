# Flow Description TODO
<!-- 1. The blockchain operator sets up the IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 service.
2. The IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 creates a Hyperledger Fabric network on an IBM Kubernetes 
Service, and the operator installs and instantiates the smart contract on the network.
3. The Node.js application server uses the Fabric SDK to interact with the deployed network on IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0 and creates APIs for a web client.
4. The Vue.js client uses the Node.js application API to interact with the network.
5. The user interacts with the Vue.js web interface to cast their ballot and
and query the world state to see current poll standings. -->
