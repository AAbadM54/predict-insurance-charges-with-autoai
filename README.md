# TODO - Flow Description
1. The user creates an Auto AI Project within IBM Watson Studio


# Included components
*	[IBM Watson Studio](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/blockchain/howto/ibp-v2-deploy-iks.html#ibp-v2-deploy-iks) gives you total control of your blockchain network with a user interface that can simplify and accelerate your journey to deploy and manage blockchain components on the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.
*	[IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service) creates a cluster of compute hosts and deploys highly available containers. A Kubernetes cluster lets you securely manage the resources that you need to quickly deploy, update, and scale applications.

## Featured technologies
+ [artificial-intelligence](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/artificial-intelligence/) Build and train models, and create apps, with a trusted AI-infused platform.
+ [Python](https://www.python.org/) Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.

## Prerequisites

This Cloud pattern assumes you have an **IBM Cloud account**.
  - [IBM Cloud account](https://tinyurl.com/y4mzxow5)
  - [Node v8.x or greater and npm v5.x or greater](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

You do not technically need VSCode or the IBM Blockchain Platform extension for VSCode if you are running the 
Cloud pattern, but if you want to make any changes to the smart contract, you will need the
extension to package your smart contract project.
